A curated list of Plonky3 resources, libraries, tools and more.

Polygon [Plonky3](https://github.com/Plonky3/Plonky3), built by Polygon Zero team, is a toolkit for implementing polynomial IOPs (PIOPs), such as PLONK and STARKs, allowing developers to configure a variety of to-spec implementations from a single ZK proving system.

## Examples
- [Fibonacci Air](https://github.com/BrianSeong99/plonky3_fibonacci): Learn the basics of Writing Air Constraints and Execution traces.
- [Range Check Air](https://github.com/BrianSeong99/plonky3_rangecheck): Learn how to compare values in Air Contraints, and optimize on constraint degrees.
- [Keccak Air](https://github.com/Plonky3/Plonky3/tree/main/keccak-air): Learn how to generate keccak hash proof in Air Constraints in multiple field(Babybear, Goldilocks, Koala, Mersenne31) and hash(Keccak, Poseidon2, Sha256) configurations
- [Poseidon2 Air](https://github.com/Plonky3/Plonky3/tree/main/poseidon2-air): Learn how to generate poseidon2 hash proof in Air Constraints.
